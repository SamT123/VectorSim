# **MSc Thesis Repository**
## About
Author: Sam Turner

This repository contains code used for my Computational Methods in Ecology and Evolution MSc thesis.

Repository for my CMEE coursework. The directory for each Week contains four subdirectories: **code**, **data**, **results** (empty, populated when scripts from code are run), and **sandbox** (code and data used in development).

Dependencies for each Week are specified in the README in the Week's subdirectory.
